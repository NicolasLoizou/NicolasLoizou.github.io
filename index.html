<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr> <br>
 I am an Assistant Professor in the <a
            href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/">
            Department of Applied
Mathematics and Statistics</a> (AMS) and the <a
    href="https://www.minds.jhu.edu/about-minds-2/">
    Mathematical Institute for Data Science </a> (MINDS),  with a
secondary appointment in the <a
    href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">
    Department of Computer Science</a> at <a
            href="https://www.jhu.edu/">
            Johns Hopkins University</a>. My current research focuses on the
          theory and applications of convex and non-convex optimization in
          large-scale machine learning and data science problems.
    <br>
    <br>
Prior to this, I was an <a
    href="https://ivado.ca/en/ivado-scholarships/postdoctoral-scholarships/">
    IVADO</a> postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">
  Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> and <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/">
DIRO, UdeM</a>, where I worked closely with <a
  href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eslacoste/"> Dr. Simon
  Lacoste-Julien </a> and <a href="http://mitliagkas.github.io">
  Dr. Ioannis Mitliagkas</a>. <br>
  I obtained my PhD from <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">The
University of Edinburgh</a>, <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/">School of Mathematics</a>. More specifically I was a member of the <a
href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/research/data-decisions/optimization-and-operational-research"> Optimization and Operational Research Group </a> under the supervision
of <a href="https://richtarik.org/index.html"> Dr. Peter Richtarik</a>.
Before that, I spent 4 beautiful years in Athens as undergraduate
student in the Department of Mathematics at <a
  href="http://en.uoa.gr/"> National and Kapodistrian University of
  Athens</a> and 1 year as postgraduate student at Imperial College
London where I obtained an <a
href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/pg/msc-specialist-degrees/cms/">MSc
in      Computing (Computational Management Science)</a>. <br>
During fall of 2018, I was a research intern at <a
  href="https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/">
  Facebook AI Research</a> in Montreal, Canada. I was working mainly
with <a href="https://research.fb.com/people/rabbat-mike/"> Dr.
  Mike Rabbat</a> on topics related to Distributed Non-Convex
Optimization Algorithms and Deep Learning. <br>
<br>
My research interests include (but are not limited to): <br>
Large Scale Optimization, Machine Learning, Randomized numerical
linear algebra, Convex Analysis, Randomized and Distributed
Algorithms. <br>
